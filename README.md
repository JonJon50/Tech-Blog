 **Hello World1 üëã**

Create an application that the user could create blog posts on and be able to input information as well as edit them. People can sign up as well.

Building this project I learned to:

1. Seed models 
2. Constructing a full stack application 
3. Use handlebars



## Installation

Go to the internet, type Brain Storm. That's it!

<br>

## Usage

1. The user will first need to login or signup before they can enter the site.
2. After the user logs in they will be able to see all the post made.
3. The user will also be able to make comments on posts. 
4. Enjoy you organized stress free day!!
